                <p class="text-gray-600">The Shop app's rapid growth pushed its monolithic MySQL database to its limits. The key challenges were:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Massive Scale:</strong> The database grew to many terabytes, with billions of rows in some tables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Bottlenecks:</strong> Schema migrations took weeks, and the database was frequently throttled during peak hours, slowing down background jobs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Scalability:</strong> Vertically scaling the single MySQL instance was no longer a viable option, and further splitting the database into more federated databases would add too much complexity to the application layer.</li>

                    <li><strong>Phase 1: "Vitessifying":</strong> The existing MySQL database was brought under Vitess management as a single, unsharded keyspace. This involved deploying a `VTTablet` process alongside each `mysqld` process and routing traffic through the `VTGate` proxy. This was done with no downtime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phase 2: Splitting into Keyspaces:</strong> The tables were then logically separated into different unsharded keyspaces (e.g., `users`, `global`) using Vitess's `MoveTables` workflow. This allowed for better organization and prepared the data for sharding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phase 3: Sharding the "Users" Keyspace:</strong> The `users` keyspace, which contained the majority of the data, was sharded based on the `user_id`. This involved setting up Sequences for auto-incrementing primary keys and Vindexes for maintaining global uniqueness. The `Reshard` workflow was used to split the data across multiple MySQL shards.</li>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Key Technical Details & Learnings</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-3">
                    <li><strong>Choosing a Sharding Key:</strong> The `user_id` was chosen as the natural sharding key, as most of the data was user-centric. This required a significant effort to backfill the `user_id` on tables where it was missing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Query Verifiers:</strong> Shopify built custom query verifiers in the application layer to find and fix queries that would be incompatible with a sharded database (e.g., queries missing a sharding key, cross-shard transactions). This was credited as the single most important factor for a successful migration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sequences for Auto-Incrementing IDs:</strong> To handle auto-incrementing primary keys in a distributed environment, Vitess Sequences were used. These are backed by a MySQL table and managed by the VTTablet to ensure unique, monotonically increasing IDs across all shards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vindexes for Uniqueness:</strong> To enforce uniqueness constraints across shards, Lookup Vindexes were used. These are essentially index tables maintained by Vitess that allow it to check for the existence of a value across all shards before an insert.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phased Rollout and Testing:</strong> The entire migration was done with extreme caution, with extensive testing in multiple staging environments. A dynamic connection switcher was built to gradually route traffic to Vitess, minimizing risk.</li>
