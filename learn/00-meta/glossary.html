            <p>Definitions of terms used throughout this repository.</p>
            <h2 id="a">A</h2>
            <p><strong>API Gateway</strong>: A service that acts as a
            single entry point for API requests, handling routing,
            authentication, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting
            concerns.</p>
            <p><strong>Availability</strong>: The fraction of time a
            system is operational and able to serve requests. Usually
            expressed as a percentage (e.g., 99.9%).</p>
            <h2 id="b">B</h2>
            <p><strong>Backpressure</strong>: A mechanism where a system
            signals upstream components to slow down when it’s
            overloaded, preventing cascading failures.</p>
            <p><strong>Bigtable</strong>: Google’s distributed NoSQL
            database, designed for low-latency, high-throughput
            workloads. Used by many Google services internally.</p>
            <p><strong>Blast Radius</strong>: The scope of impact when a
            component fails. A small blast radius means failures are
            isolated.</p>
            <h2 id="c">C</h2>
            <p><strong>Canary Deployment</strong>: A deployment strategy
            where a new version is deployed to a small subset of
            instances first, monitored, and then gradually rolled
            out.</p>
            <p><strong>CAP Theorem</strong>: States that a distributed
            system can guarantee at most two of: Consistency,
            Availability, Partition tolerance.</p>
            <p><strong>Circuit Breaker</strong>: A pattern that prevents
            calls to a failing service, allowing it to recover and
            preventing cascading failures.</p>
            <p><strong>Consensus</strong>: Agreement among distributed
            nodes on a value or state. Algorithms like Raft and Paxos
            solve consensus.</p>
            <p><strong>Consistency</strong>: In distributed systems,
            refers to whether all nodes see the same data at the same
            time. Can be strong (linearizable) or weak (eventual).</p>
            <h2 id="d">D</h2>
            <p><strong>Distributed System</strong>: A system where
            components are located on different networked computers and
            coordinate to achieve a common goal.</p>
            <p><strong>Durability</strong>: The guarantee that once data
            is written, it will persist even if the system fails.</p>
            <h2 id="e">E</h2>
            <p><strong>Error Budget</strong>: The amount of
            unreliability a service can tolerate while still meeting its
            SLO. Calculated as 1 - SLO.</p>
            <p><strong>Eventual Consistency</strong>: A consistency
            model where, after updates stop, all nodes will eventually
            converge to the same state, but may temporarily have
            different values.</p>
            <h2 id="f">F</h2>
            <p><strong>Failure Domain</strong>: A set of components that
            fail together. Good design minimizes failure domains and
            limits blast radius.</p>
            <h2 id="g">G</h2>
            <p><strong>GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)</strong>: Google’s
            managed Kubernetes service, running on GCP.</p>
            <h2 id="i">I</h2>
            <p><strong>IAM (Identity and Access Management)</strong>:
            System for managing who can access what resources. In GCP,
            controls authentication and authorization.</p>
            <p><strong>Idempotency</strong>: Property where performing
            an operation multiple times has the same effect as
            performing it once. Critical for retries.</p>
            <h2 id="l">L</h2>
            <p><strong>Latency</strong>: Time taken for a request to
            complete. Usually measured as P50 (median), P95, P99
            (percentiles).</p>
            <p><strong>Lease</strong>: A time-limited lock that grants
            exclusive access to a resource. Expires automatically,
            preventing deadlocks.</p>
            <p><strong>Linearizability</strong>: Strongest consistency
            model. All operations appear to occur atomically at some
            point in time.</p>
            <p><strong>Load Shedding</strong>: Dropping requests when a
            system is overloaded to prevent total failure. Better to
            serve some requests than none.</p>
            <h2 id="m">M</h2>
            <p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: A simplified
            representation of how a system works, used for reasoning
            about behavior and failures.</p>
            <h2 id="o">O</h2>
            <p><strong>Observability</strong>: The ability to understand
            a system’s internal state from its external outputs
            (metrics, logs, traces).</p>
            <p><strong>Overload</strong>: When a system receives more
            load than it can handle, leading to degradation or
            failure.</p>
            <h2 id="p">P</h2>
            <p><strong>Partition Tolerance</strong>: The ability of a
            distributed system to continue operating despite network
            partitions (nodes can’t communicate).</p>
            <p><strong>Paxos</strong>: A consensus algorithm for
            distributed systems. Complex but proven correct.</p>
            <p><strong>Percentile (P50, P95, P99)</strong>: A measure of
            latency distribution. P95 means 95% of requests complete in
            this time or less.</p>
            <p><strong>PRR (Production Readiness Review)</strong>: A
            review process to ensure a system is ready for production,
            covering reliability, security, operations.</p>
            <p><strong>Pub/Sub</strong>: Publish-subscribe messaging
            system. Publishers send messages to topics, subscribers
            receive messages from subscriptions.</p>
            <h2 id="q">Q</h2>
            <p><strong>QPS (Queries Per Second)</strong>: A measure of
            throughput, the number of requests a system handles per
            second.</p>
            <p><strong>Queueing Theory</strong>: Mathematical study of
            waiting lines. Explains tail latency and helps with capacity
            planning.</p>
            <h2 id="r">R</h2>
            <p><strong>Raft</strong>: A consensus algorithm simpler than
            Paxos, commonly used in distributed systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: Controlling the rate of
            requests to prevent overload and ensure fair resource
            usage.</p>
            <p><strong>Replication</strong>: Storing copies of data on
            multiple nodes for availability and performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Retry</strong>: Attempting an operation again
            after it fails. Requires idempotency to be safe.</p>
            <h2 id="s">S</h2>
            <p><strong>Sharding</strong>: Partitioning data across
            multiple nodes. Each shard contains a subset of data.</p>
            <p><strong>SLI (Service Level Indicator)</strong>: A
            quantitative measure of service quality (e.g., latency,
            availability, error rate).</p>
            <p><strong>SLO (Service Level Objective)</strong>: A target
            value for an SLI (e.g., “P95 latency &lt; 100ms”,
            “availability &gt; 99.9%”).</p>
            <p><strong>Spanner</strong>: Google’s globally distributed
            SQL database with strong consistency guarantees, using
            TrueTime for external consistency.</p>
            <h2 id="t">T</h2>
            <p><strong>Tail Latency</strong>: High percentiles of
            latency (P95, P99). Often much higher than median due to
            queueing and resource contention.</p>
            <p><strong>Throughput</strong>: The rate at which a system
            processes requests, usually measured in QPS or requests per
            second.</p>
            <p><strong>TrueTime</strong>: Google’s clock synchronization
            service used by Spanner to provide external consistency
            guarantees.</p>
            <h2 id="v">V</h2>
            <p><strong>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</strong>: A logically
            isolated network in GCP where you can launch resources with
            private IP addresses.</p>
