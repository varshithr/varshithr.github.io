## Research Papers

**"Replication"** (Gray & Reuter, 1993)
- Classic replication paper
- Replication strategies and tradeoffs

---

## Additional Resources

### Books

**"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"** by Martin Kleppmann
- Chapter on replication
- Master-slave, multi-master, quorum

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Master-slave**: Strong consistency, read scaling
2. **Multi-master**: High availability, write scaling
3. **Quorum**: Balance consistency and availability
4. **Tradeoffs**: Consistency vs availability vs performance
