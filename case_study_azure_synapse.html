                <p class="text-gray-600">A global CPG company was struggling to get a unified view of its operations. Their data was fragmented across numerous systems:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                    <li>An on-premises SQL Server for sales and transactional data.</li>
                    <li>A separate cloud data warehouse for marketing campaign data.</li>
                    <li>Multiple ERP systems (like SAP) for supply chain and inventory management.</li>
                    <li>Third-party market share data delivered as flat files.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">This fragmentation made it incredibly difficult to answer critical business questions, such as "How does a social media campaign in a specific region impact store-level inventory?" The goal was to create a single, unified analytics platform to provide a 360-degree view of the business.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Azure Synapse Analytics was selected to break down the data silos and provide a unified workspace for all data professionals:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
                    <li><strong>Data Integration Hub:</strong> <strong>Synapse Pipelines</strong> (powered by Azure Data Factory) act as the central ingestion engine. It uses pre-built connectors to pull data from the on-premises SQL Server, the marketing warehouse, and the ERP systems, landing it all in <strong>Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Enterprise Data Lake:</strong> ADLS Gen2 serves as the single source of truth, storing all raw and processed data in a hierarchical namespace optimized for analytics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Modal Compute:</strong> This is where Synapse shines. Different teams use different compute engines on the same data lake, all within the <strong>Synapse Studio</strong> workspace:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Data Engineers</strong> use <strong>Synapse Spark Pools</strong> to run large-scale data transformation jobs in Scala and Python, cleaning and modeling the data into a star schema.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Analysts</strong> use <strong>Synapse Serverless SQL Pools</strong> for ad-hoc, exploratory queries directly on the files in the data lake, paying only for the queries they run.</li>
                            <li><strong>BI Professionals</strong> use <strong>Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools</strong> (a provisioned MPP data warehouse) to host the final, curated data models for high-performance dashboards.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning & BI:</strong> Data scientists use the same Synapse Spark Pools to train demand forecasting models. The results are written back to the data lake and served to business users via interactive <strong>Power BI</strong> reports that are seamlessly integrated into the Synapse Studio.</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="card">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Key Technical Details</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-3">
                    <li><strong>Unified Workspace with Synapse Studio:</strong> The ability for data engineers, analysts, and data scientists to collaborate in a single web UI was a major productivity booster. It eliminated the need to switch between different tools for data integration, data warehousing, and machine learning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost Optimization with Hybrid Compute:</strong> The company heavily utilized the serverless SQL pools for data exploration, which significantly reduced costs compared to running a dedicated data warehouse 24/7. Dedicated pools were reserved for the most critical, high-concurrency BI workloads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Code-Free and Code-First Flexibility:</strong> Data engineers used the visual, drag-and-drop Data Flows within Synapse Pipelines for standard ETL tasks, which accelerated development. For more complex transformations, they used Spark notebooks, providing the flexibility to switch between low-code and code-first approaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>End-to-End Security and Governance:</strong> The entire platform is secured with <strong>Azure Active Directory</strong>. Synapse's built-in capabilities for column-level security (CLS) and row-level security (RLS) ensure that different user groups (e.g., marketing, finance) can only see the data they are authorized to access, even when querying the same underlying tables.</li>
