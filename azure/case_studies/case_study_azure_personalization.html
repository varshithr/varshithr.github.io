                    <li>Help customers discover new trends and products in a personalized manner.</li>
                    <li>Scale to millions of users with variable demand.</li>

                    <li><strong>Conversational Interface:</strong> The user interacts with the virtual stylist through a chat interface powered by <strong>Azure Bot Service</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Language & Vision Understanding:</strong> <strong>Azure Cognitive Services</strong> are used to understand the user's intent. The <strong>Language Understanding (LUIS)</strong> service processes text inputs, while the <strong>Computer Vision</strong> service can analyze images uploaded by the user (e.g., "find me a dress like this").</li>
                    <li><strong>Personalization Engine:</strong> A custom personalization engine, likely running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Machine Learning, takes the structured output from the Cognitive Services and combines it with the user's profile and historical data to generate relevant product recommendations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> The personalization engine queries the product catalog and user data, which are stored in a scalable database like Azure Cosmos DB or Azure SQL.</li>

                    <li><strong>Rapid Development with Azure AI Foundry:</strong> This program provided ASOS with access to Microsoft's AI experts and a curated set of tools, accelerating the development and deployment of their intelligent app.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Modal AI:</strong> The ability to handle both text (natural language) and images (computer vision) was key to creating a truly interactive and helpful virtual stylist.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability and Reliability:</strong> By building on Azure's managed services, ASOS ensured that their application could handle variable user demand and scale globally without requiring a large investment in infrastructure management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Customer Engagement:</strong> The conversational interface provides a more engaging and personalized experience than traditional web or app navigation, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.</li>
