- SQL and data modeling concepts
- Databricks and data lake architectures

## Structure
The site is organized by cloud platform with dedicated sections for:
- **AWS**: S3, EMR, Glue, Redshift, Kinesis
- **GCP**: BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Bigtable, Composer
- **Azure**: Data Factory, Event Hubs, ADLS
- **Databricks**: Lakehouse architecture, Delta Lake
- **SQL**: Query optimization, modeling techniques

## Purpose
Created as a reference guide for data engineers preparing for interviews or looking to understand specific cloud services and their applications in real-world scenarios.
